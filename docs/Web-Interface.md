After installation on the streamer there will be a web interface available at `http://192.168.1.89` - change the IP to the IP of your streamer.

A Swagger UI with the full API documentation is available at `/swagger` (e.g. `http://192.168.1.89/swagger`).

## Config Editor
The `Config Editor` should be pretty self-explanatory. The one setting you will have to change is the host.

!!! warning
    Please be aware that a reboot is required after changing the configuration.

### Network
#### Ports
Here you can change the default ports for the web interface and the services. You really only need to change those settings if you are running other services on the same pi which **need** those ports.

> Generally, this section can be left alone.

#### WiFi
WiFi can either be run in client or in AP mode. In client mode it will try to connect to the network configured when you initially flashed the image. In AP mode, it will spawn its own WiFi network to which you can connect.

The default AP network is `v3xctrl-<device_id>`.
The default password is `raspberry`.

> See [Defaults](Defaults.md) for all default credentials and ports.

I suggest to keep the device in client mode as long as you are setting it up and then switch it to AP mode when you are done. This will allow you to connect to the device on the field via your phone.

#### Modem
The most important section here are the Bands. You might need to adjust the bands for your region. Best use cellmapper to find out which bands are available in your region for your provider. See the [Antennas page](Antennas.md) for a detailed guide.

> We also noted that the modem seems to prefer the higher frequency, higher throughput bands, which might not be the best choice in rural regions. We found out, that pinning the modem to a single band might yield WAY better results. In rural regions with not so great coverage that would be the lower frequency bands (Band 20 in the EU for example).

!!! warning
    When limiting bands, make sure that those bands are actually available, otherwise your modem will not be able to register with the provider. Only limit yourself to a single band if you know what you are doing.

## Services
Allows you to manage all relevant services. You can see their current states, start and stop them and see their logs.

## Calibration
Allows you to calibrate steering and throttle.

## DMESG
Shows the kernel logs of the current session, very important for debugging.

## Modem
Shows information about the modem. This will help you the most to debug connectivity issues:

If **SIM Status** is anything else than "OK", your SIM is either not inserted, not recognized or the PIN is not disabled.

**Allowed Bands** shows the currently configured allowed bands, make sure that you can see some of the bands here that your carrier uses (check with [cellmapper](https://cellmapper.net)).
